# Service Oriented ViewModel - MonkeySpace 2013

These are the slides for the presenation I gave at MonkeySpace 2013. 
They describe a base class that updates ViewModel properties with service requests.
I also give some prompts for thinking about using MVVM with SOA.

See the raw presentation outline in [presentation.md](./presentation.md)
